<h2><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v" id="Page_v">[v]</a></span><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE">PREFACE</a></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Dear Mrs. Pollen</span>,&mdash;Having examined the admirable photographs to your
lace collection, and the letterpress which you have written to accompany
them, with a view to meet your wish that I should make revisions and
suchlike where I thought necessary, please allow me in the first place
to thank you for having entrusted me with what has been a very congenial
work, and to say that I really have but few suggestions to offer. Such
as they are, they amount to little more than amplifying, and slightly
modifying here and there, what you have written.</p>

<p>Your glossary of terms used in describing lace and cognate work is very
full, and contains several Italian terms which strike me as being
unquestionably of technical value in supplementing information put
forward in the best English works on lace-making.</p>

<p>Upon the introductory part of your attractive letterpress you also asked
me to freely express an opinion, giving it such a shape as to make it
suitable for use as a preface to your work. I now do this with
considerable diffidence, notwithstanding that during a good many years I
have had a large number of specimens of lace before me, including
probably some of the finest ever made. You had the initial advantage of
inheriting lace of incontestable origin and antiquity, and also of
finding specimens in different countries where facts and traditions of
their manufacture could be ascertained on the spot.</p>

<p>For so long a period as that from, say, the sixteenth to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span> eighteenth
centuries, men derived as much satisfaction in acquiring and wearing
laces as women then did. But <i>autres temps, autres m&#x0153;urs</i>, and
closely as our sex may at one time have run yours in the appreciation of
lace, yours has outstripped and beaten ours. This, of course, is as it
should be, for skill in all forms of needlework and dainty thread-work
has practically been the monopoly of women from the time of Penelope
forwards, notwithstanding the strict observance of the rule laid down by
St. Benedict that the members of his Order should be expert in the use
of both pen and needle (as they were for centuries); or the records of
the seventeenth century, that boys attended lace-making schools in
Devonshire, and that English tailors and labouring men often made good
saleable lace in their leisure time during the eighteenth century.</p>

<p>With your suggestion that many sorts of white thread ornamental work,
from which a development of needle-made and bobbin-made laces can be
traced, are of earlier date than the sixteenth century, I entirely
agree; and in corroboration of this, various public collections, within
comparatively recent times, have secured from disused ancient Coptic
cemeteries in Egypt fragments of elaborate nettings and Saracenic
examples of that kind of work which you identify with the Italian
"Sfilatura" and "punto a stuora." This last-named stitch is virtually
the stitch used in tapestry-making, and it often appears on a small
scale in intricate, drawn and whipped thread Persian linen embroidery,
the practice of which is assuredly of great age. These methods of
stitching for ornamental purposes appear to have been well known in
countries coming at some time or another under the direct influence of
Saracenic embroiderers; but it is interesting to note they are not
identical in character with that of buttonhole stitching, which plays so
important a part in lace-making.</p>

<p>The essential feature of the fabric now recognised as lace lies in its
being wrought independently of any visible foundation such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[vii]</a></span> as linen or
net; it is essentially a textile ornamentation depending upon special
design, which can be rendered, so far as needle-point lace is concerned,
by variations of the buttonhole stitch&mdash;the "punto a festone" in Italy,
and "point noué" in France&mdash;which is distinctively a looping, and not a
whipping or weaving, stitch; and so far as bobbin-made lace is
concerned, by twisting and plaiting threads together.</p>

<p>The genesis of ornamental design for such laces is, I fancy, pretty well
established through the classification of kindred designs, beginning
with those involving simple abstract and geometric forms; these are
gradually succeeded by others with conventional and more varied devices,
suggesting plant and animal life; and these followed by others in which
definitely realistic renderings of actual things are aimed at. Thus,
very broadly, we have three typical groups, and of the first your
photographs Nos. <a href="#plate_003">3</a>, <a href="#plate_006">6</a>, <a href="#plate_007">7</a>, with <a href="#plate_029">29</a>, <a href="#plate_030">30</a>, and <a href="#plate_086">86</a>, give examples; of the
second group there are examples in photographs Nos. <a href="#plate_011">11</a>, <a href="#plate_012">12</a>, <a href="#plate_016">16</a>, <a href="#plate_017">17</a>, &amp;c.;
and the third group is illustrated by Nos. <a href="#plate_036">36</a> and <a href="#plate_037">37</a>, <a href="#plate_090">90</a> to <a href="#plate_093">93</a>, and <a href="#plate_116">116</a>.</p>

<p>The sixteenth-century Italian pattern books are mainly concerned with
designs for lace of the first group as distinct from embroidery on linen
or net. The period of the second group is established by the laces one
finds represented in paintings by such painters as Vandyck, Rembrandt,
Gonzales Coques, Mignard, and Hyacinthe Rigaud, whilst the generality of
the designs in the third group is safely attributable to designers
employed towards the end of the seventeenth century, and during the
eighteenth by the Royal or State subsidised manufactories of France,
about which several local records, quoted by Mademoiselle Despierre in
her book on the Points d'Alençon, are particularly interesting. Laces of
rather indeterminate design, such as those which we call peasant laces,
have, as a rule, a quaint treatment of pattern, the origin of which is,
I think, almost invariably to be referred to some carefully designed
prototype; but the charm of such peasant laces lies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span> chiefly in the
goodness of their texture combined with a distortion of forms, which
arises from the workers' naïveté in misunderstanding the parent design.
The really valuable work was that of sympathetic and skilled workers,
done directly from well-designed patterns.</p>

<p>Now the origin of needle-point and bobbin-made laces is, I think,
Occidental, or European, and not Oriental; and the three broadly
indicated pattern groups are accompanied by three equally recognisable
sorts of texture. The first of them is comparatively stiff and wiry; the
second more lissom and inclined to tapiness; and the third, still more
lissom, becoming gauzy and filmy in quality. Delicate, filmy laces,
common to the eighteenth century, could not, therefore, I think, have
been dreamt of in the sixteenth century; neither at that time was there
a conception of the tapey, and at times linen-like, laces made in the
early part and middle of the seventeenth century. Hence we seem able to
rely upon an apparent procession of design types, running concurrently
with an equally apparent procession of qualities of texture. By keeping
in mind these combined successions of pattern and texture one is enabled
not only to classify laces, but also to account for later survivals of
old types, as well as for the approximate dates when old and new types
severally have arisen.</p>

<p>It is evident that the French word "dentelle," which is a comprehensive
term for laces, came from the "dents," or tooth-shaped borders and edges
of lace made soon after the beginning of the sixteenth century. At the
same time, there had been during two centuries earlier, a fashion of
jagging or cutting into points or scallops the borders of cloth silk and
velvet costumes, gowns, hoods, and long sleeves. But when the notably
increased use of linen shirts, with cuffs and small collars just showing
beyond the outer garments occurred in the sixteenth century, white and
coloured thread purlings and taut fringings or edgings were made for
them, and so came to be called "points," "dents" and "punti" as the cut
borders of cloth costumes had been. The latter fashion gradually
obscured the former, and thus the terms "point," "dent," and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[ix]</a></span> "punto"
were almost solely applied to ornamentation in real lace or in lace-like
fabrics. In still later times, as you notice, point lace is generally
understood to be the designation of needle-point lace, or "dentelle à
l'aiguille," as distinct from the "dentelle au fuseau," bobbin or
pillow-made lace.</p>

<p>I have been tempted to touch upon this matter of lace points, vandykes,
and scallops because the border of the alb, said to have been worn by
Pope Boniface VIII., consists of scallops of bobbin-made thread-work,
and of a type of pattern and texture which I should say cannot very well
be earlier in date than the middle of the sixteenth century. On the
other hand, the ornamental thread-work done in "punto di treccia" and
"punto a stuora," which fills large and small squares and remarkable
five-sided figures, seems to have some Saracenic or Moorish character,
and may possibly not be assignable to the sixteenth century with the
same cogency of inference as applies to the scallops of Italian
"merletti a piombini" on the border of the alb.</p>

<p>Whatever may be the result of further inquiries concerning the tradition
of Pope Boniface having worn this alb, and therefore establishing its
date as being late thirteenth century, I hope that you will retain it as
an illustration in your book.</p>

<p>Whilst the majority of your photographs are from generally well-known
varieties of lace, those from the earlier drawn thread-works and darning
upon different makes of square mesh, net, or grounds of radiating,
intertwisted threads, are particularly interesting&mdash;and the entire
series, accompanied by your descriptions, forms a most valuable
encyclopædia of designs and textures to be seen in laces and cognate
fabrics.</p>

<p>The idea of giving, by means of photography, full-sized reproductions of
my specimens of ancient needle and bobbin-made lace, originated from a
desire to avoid unfolding these delicate fabrics when my friends wished
to see them. By arranging carefully that several of the photographs
should give the exact size of each stitch of the work, seeing and
handling the originals have been rendered practically unnecessary.
Though many books on lace exist giving most valuable historic, artistic
and technical data, none with which I am acquainted give the practical
information I have found most desired, that is to say, full-sized
representations of the pieces of lace. I therefore think that such
reproductions of my specimens may have a wider interest than I had
originally imagined, and accordingly I have now prepared them for
general publication.</p>

<p>It is impossible to judge of lace from a mere picture of pretty and
artistic drapery, or from portraits of great personages wearing lace
collars or dress trimmings. Lace in pictures has, in the first place,
been interpreted by the painter, and no pencil or brush can show more
than the general effect. The stitches in the toilé, or ground of
needle-point lace, amount sometimes to several thousand in every square
inch; and the almost incredible fineness of the twists in the réseau of
pillow laces makes identification very difficult, unless it is founded
on observation of actual portions of the fabric. It can hardly be
contested that, apart from some generally accepted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span> deductions as to
design and time of execution, the chief means of judging lace correctly
lies in studying the toilé or clothing, and the groundwork of meshes or
réseau. To assist in this, many of the examples of my lace in their
actual size, and in some cases greatly enlarged photographs, are given.</p>

<p>I have illustrated and described only fabrics which, if not in my
possession, have actually come under my observation, such as the two
ancient albs of Eastern design, which, although hitherto unnoticed by
Italian writers on lace, may, I think, claim to have formed a very
interesting link between the Coptic or Egypto-Roman design, and that of
the early Italian lace. To aid in a judgment on this point, I also
illustrate some designs from early Coptic tombs.</p>

<p>The pre-Reformation "Pyx Veil" of needle-point linen work or tela tirata
remains the property of the parish of Hessett in Suffolk. It is a
supremely interesting object and unique, as far as I know, in the way it
is worked. I therefore give two illustrations of it among the early
sixteenth-century linen laces.</p>

<p>The period to which I confine my treatment of this art prevents my
giving any account of the very successful and extensive revival of
lace-making which has taken place all over Europe during the last sixty
years. Italy, France, and Great Britain have already some hundreds of
lace centres, while, from Denmark to Madagascar, Sweden to Ceylon, I
have specimens of most excellent and praiseworthy industries. That
these, as well as the very beautiful fabrics made now by lace machines,
may prosper, must be the wish of all&mdash;and I believe that to study more
and more carefully the models of the past will be the secret of success.</p>

<p>I classify lace as needle-point and bobbin-point. Numerous varieties
occur in each, but I will only mention the three chief divisions I make
in each class.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span></p>

<p>The three chief kinds of needle-point, "Trine ad Ago," are:</p>

<blockquote><p>1. Lacis (or Modano) and Buratto work. (<i>See</i> Plates <a href="#plate_008">8</a>, <a href="#plate_011">11</a>, <a href="#plate_017">17</a>.) I
include also under Lacis those varieties which are called in
Italy Sfilature, as the ancient specimens are, I find, usually
worked on a foundation of knotted lacis. <i>See</i> Plate <a href="#plate_007">7</a>.</p>

<p>2. Linen lace, comprising reticello work and tela tirata. <i>See</i>
Plates <a href="#plate_014">14</a>, <a href="#plate_019">19</a>, <a href="#plate_025">25</a>.</p>

<p>3. Punto in aria&mdash;of which all later needle-point laces are
varieties. <i>See</i> Plates <a href="#plate_031">31</a> and <a href="#plate_032">32</a>.</p></blockquote>

<p>The three chief ways of making bobbin-lace, "Trine a fuselli," are:</p>

<blockquote><p>1. A tape, sometimes plain, sometimes ornamented, is made on the
pillow. This tape is placed and arranged as wished and joined up
on the pillow, but it is not cut or finished off, but continues
to form the pattern until the lace is completed. <i>See</i> Plates <a href="#plate_083">83</a>
and <a href="#plate_084">84</a>.</p>

<p>2. Complete sprays or patterns are made on the pillow and finished
off; these are afterwards joined by brides or by a réseau. <i>See</i>
Plates <a href="#plate_090">90</a> and <a href="#plate_091">91</a>.</p>

<p>3. The bobbins first used, continue and complete both pattern and
ground of the whole length of the lace. <i>See</i> Plate <a href="#plate_097">97</a>.</p></blockquote>

<p>I here give a Glossary, the result of inquiries tabulated during a stay
in Italy some years ago. I cannot find any authoritative translation of
the technical terms used to describe ancient lace, so I give my
interpretations for what they are worth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>Many books giving patterns for lace-making were produced in the
sixteenth century, but few of them afford any technical instruction in
the art, and all assume that lace was already in demand throughout
Europe. We need not therefore take these interesting little books into
consideration in determining the antiquity of lace, although they are of
great assistance on the question of design, as they constantly show by
introducing the gammadion and other symbols, the survival of the
Oriental tradition.<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> This is also clearly shown in the numerous
specimens of embroideries and woven silks made in Sicily and Spain in
the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, and preserved in our own and
Continental museums.</p>

<p>The earliest specimens of lace stitches in my possession are on pieces
of Coptic linen work from tombs of the third to the fifth century from
the collection of Mr. R. de Rustafjaell. The threads purposely left
loose in the weaving are held by punto a rammendo worked in white linen
thread. A background of coloured worsted is afterwards added,<a name="FNanchor_B_2" id="FNanchor_B_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a> (<i>See</i>
Plate <a href="#plate_004">4</a>.) It is interesting to compare the towel, <span class="smcap">No.</span> 1 in Plate <a href="#plate_028">28</a>,
which in my opinion has probably been worked in the same way, that is,
the weaver has omitted the woof threads, leaving only the warp threads
to be drawn together by needlework. The bobbin-lace found in the same
tomb is illustrated in Plate <a href="#plate_005">5</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>The first mention of lace-making in Europe that I know of is an old rule
of the thirteenth century for English nuns, cautioning them against
devoting too much time to lace and ornamental work to the detriment of
work for the poor.<a name="FNanchor_C_3" id="FNanchor_C_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_C_3" class="fnanchor">[C]</a></p>

<p>This <i>laz</i> or lace was doubtless lacis. This lacis or network, now
called modano in Italy, was the earliest foundation for the work of
needle-made lace "trine ad ago." We find in the Appendix to Dugdale's
History of St. Paul's mention of work of "albo filo nodato" knotted
white thread. This was noted at a Visitation made in 1295.<a name="FNanchor_D_4" id="FNanchor_D_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_D_4" class="fnanchor">[D]</a> But pieces
of this opus sfilatorium have also been found in Egyptian tombs. Early
specimens often have the gammadion or symbol of the cross. <i>See</i> Plate
<a href="#plate_004">4</a>.</p>

<p>A roll of the possessions of the Templars after their suppression in
1312 includes an inventory of the goods of Temple Church. One item of
this is "one net which is called <i>Espinum</i> to cover Lectern, 2<i>s.</i>"<a name="FNanchor_E_5" id="FNanchor_E_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_E_5" class="fnanchor">[E]</a>
We must look to the specimens existing from early times in Europe, and
to contemporary testimony, whether of painting or sculpture, to enable
us to fix the date of these interesting productions of human
industry&mdash;the early lacis and linen laces. Embroidery on silk, in which
many of the lace stitches were used, has a very early record.</p>

<p>Here we need only cite the many magnificent examples of embroidered
Church vestments, chasubles, copes, &amp;c., so freely produced from the
thirteenth century onwards, of which the wonderful Dalmatic of the ninth
century in the Vatican Treasury, the Syon Cope of the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>thirteenth
century in the Victoria and Albert Museum, together with others, are to
this date in excellent and almost perfect condition.</p>

<p>Now, if we remember that albs and other linen vestments used at Mass
have been for centuries as necessary and important as the outer ones of
silk, it must be allowed that while such a wealth of decoration was
lavished on the latter, adornment of the former was not likely to have
been omitted. I am, therefore, of opinion that much of the lacis, tela
tirata, and reticello work generally ascribed to the fifteenth and
sixteenth centuries, may more correctly be considered to be earlier in
date. That few of such ancient specimens remain is no doubt due to the
linen thread being less durable than the silk and also to that arch
enemy of lace in all ages, the washerwoman. As silk and gold embroidery
could not be washed, it survived. All who have to care for Church
vestments at the present time know that albs and other linen objects for
Church use are comparatively short-lived, and it must be remembered that
lace in early times was chiefly made for Church purposes.</p>

<p>After consulting illuminated manuscripts of the eighth and ninth
centuries, I have come to the conclusion that there is in them strong
evidence of lacework having been employed to ornament the albs worn even
at those periods. St. Mark, in a Gospel (now in the Bibliothèque
Nationale, Paris) said to have been written for Charlemagne, wears an
alb which appears to me to be of this kind. Also in the Bibliothèque
Nationale, Paris, is a twelfth-century Bible, called the Bible of St.
Martial, in which the Bishop is pictured wearing a highly ornamental alb
under his gothic-shaped chasuble. He grasps his pastoral staff in one
hand, and with the other he receives the precious Book.<a name="FNanchor_F_6" id="FNanchor_F_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_F_6" class="fnanchor">[F]</a></p>

<p>On the question of design, as indicating the date of lacework, I am of
opinion that the early geometric character of primitive design was
sooner modified than is generally thought to be the case.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>We find, for instance, in an eighth-century "Gospel" in the Bibliothèque
Nationale of Paris, a scroll ornament painted with vine leaves, grapes,
&amp;c.</p>

<p>Why should not this have inspired a laceworker of the same period to
attempt a similar design? At a little later date a "Sacramentaire" has
most realistic flowers and leaves ornamenting the initials in the
Manuscript. These beautiful works of art were executed by religious
persons and monks, probably of the Benedictine Order. A great part of
the lace made at the same time was undoubtedly the work of nuns. What
more likely than that mutual assistance was given to carry out the
principal aim of both&mdash;the ornamentation and glory of the Sacred
Scriptures, and the services of the Church?</p>

<p>Many of the earlier albs are decorated with passemens or apparels, which
are squares or oblongs of ornamental work often enriched with gold
thread. These were sewn on the lower part of the front of the alb and on
the cuff of the sleeve. The alb preserved at the Cathedral of Sens, and
said to have been worn by St. Thomas of Canterbury, is ornamented in
this way. In some of the old books of patterns for lace, the
straight-edged laces are all called passemens, and only the pointed ones
dentelles, or pizzi.</p>

<p>Later the apparels gave place to ornament worked on the linen itself,
and often forming a continuous band of decoration more or less wide
round the edge. A tombstone on the floor of the church of St. Sabina in
Rome has a recumbent figure with an alb decorated with a band of this
kind. The inscription denotes that the figure represents a German abbot,
named Egidius Varnsprach; the date is 1312. Later still, lace of all
kinds was merely sewn on to the alb as a flounce, in the way usually
adopted at the present time.</p>

<p>As far as I am aware, only two complete albs of early linen lace exist.
They are both of very fine texture, the thread of the linen having been
spun with great care and the weaving very closely done. The oldest is
the alb, Plate <a href="#plate_001">1</a>, which is said to have been woven and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span> ornamented by
St. Clare of Assisi and her nuns, and is still preserved in the
monastery of that place. The tradition is that it was worn by St.
Francis of Assisi. I was fortunately able to examine it closely and to
obtain details of the lacework, which is worked on the linen itself in
tela tirata and punto reale. Symbolic animals and chimeras are
introduced, but the polygonal character of the design is preserved
throughout, and establishes, I consider, its Coptic derivation.</p>

<p>To confirm this, I need only instance the fact that these, and other
earliest known specimens of lacis and linen lace existing, are almost
identical in design with the forms familiar to us from the discoveries
in Coptic tombs in Egypt from the first and third centuries onwards.
These designs, simple and formal as they appear, are really full of
meaning. Mr. Albert Gayet has pointed out, in his history of Coptic art,
that the law of polygonal evolution only completed in the eleventh
century the course it had steadfastly pursued from the beginning. He
continues: "It seems a far cry from the early Greek tradition to this
time. But the Coptic artist was never in sympathy with the Greek
striving towards realism. He wished to express, not the image itself,
but the impression conveyed by the image. He preferred the thought to
the concrete form. The divine idea, which to the Greek must mean a
precise representation, he prefers to render quite otherwise. The
fidelity of the Coptic artist to this polygony renders it the key to all
his art. His first efforts are blunders, but he is not discouraged, he
continues without hesitation to follow his ideal. He finds in the
philosophy of the polygon the impression he wishes to convey of the
ideal and the invisible. His composition, according to the Gnostic
definition, has its secret side, hidden under the emblem shown, while
the emblem shown has also a hidden side. Then by the superposition of
<i>entrelacs</i>, or strap-work, he conveys the idea of evolution, or things
(mysteries) turning and repeating themselves indefinitely, but always in
an inflexible circle." For example, a number of star-centred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span> octagons,
formed by a network of lines, will have a cross in the centre&mdash;other
little crosses may be traced in each star&mdash;and in the arabesques of the
corners crosses may also be found. "Everywhere, even in the most closely
packed work, this symbol can be found; the most abstract geometrical
combinations are still subject to the same system. Polygony places
everywhere and always the sign of the Faith."<a name="FNanchor_G_7" id="FNanchor_G_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_G_7" class="fnanchor">[G]</a></p>

<p>I must also make a quotation from the learned Dr. Rock, which, though
written nearly forty years ago, is so apposite while considering this
beautiful lacework from Assisi and its Eastern derivation.</p>

<p>Strengthening our idea that the old Egyptians had borrowed the cross as
a spell against evil, and a symbol of eternal life, is a passage set
forth by Rufinus, <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 397, and by Socrates <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> 440.</p>

<p>"On demolishing at Alexandria a temple dedicated to Serapis, were
observed several stones sculptured with letters called hieroglyphics,
which showed the figures of a cross. Certain Gentile inhabitants of the
city who had lately been converted to the Christian faith, initiated in
the method of interpreting these enigmatic characters, declared that the
figure of the cross was considered as the symbol of future life."<a name="FNanchor_H_8" id="FNanchor_H_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_H_8" class="fnanchor">[H]</a></p>

<p>"We know that modifications of the form of the cross have been found on
monuments already discovered; others may turn up with the so-called
'gammadion' found upon Egyptian stuff of such an early date. The
recurrence of the gammadion upon Christian monuments is curious. It is
shown in the catacombs, and in numerous later instances. Christianity
widened the meaning of this symbol and made it teach the doctrine of the
Atonement of Calvary, and that Christ is our corner-stone. In the
thirteenth century it was taken to be an apt memorial of His five wounds
and, remembering the stigmata of St. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>Francis of Assisi, this gammadion
became the favourite device of such as bore that Saint's name."<a name="FNanchor_I_9" id="FNanchor_I_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_I_9" class="fnanchor">[I]</a></p>

<p>No less than twenty varieties of these polygonal ornaments, many of them
introducing the gammadion, are to be found in the lacework of the Assisi
alb. <i>See</i> Plate <a href="#plate_003">3</a>.</p>

<p>The tradition mentioned by Dr. Rock of the device of the gammadion being
identified with St. Francis may, I think, have originated in the
circumstance of his having worn this alb. In Plate <a href="#plate_006">6</a> I give two examples
of early Italian punto reale of the same kind although very inferior in
variety and in workmanship, but in most of these early "cartiglia," as
this work is called in Italy, the polygonal idea is still predominant.</p>

<p>The other complete alb is also of linen lace, and is said to have been
worn by Pope Boniface VIII. in 1298. (<i>See</i> Plate <a href="#plate_002">2</a>.) It is preserved in
the Treasury of the Sistine Chapel in the Vatican, where I had an
opportunity of examining it closely and of obtaining the technical
details I give. As to its possible history I may note that St. Nilos and
his monks were driven from the East by the Saracens at the end of the
tenth century, and came to Italy, where they were welcomed by Pope
Gregory V. He established them in the monastery a few miles from Rome,
where their successors still worship with their Eastern rites. The
famous alb may have been brought by these very monks or those who
followed them from the East.<a name="FNanchor_J_10" id="FNanchor_J_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_J_10" class="fnanchor">[J]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>Then, as now, specimens of the world's treasures of art and handicraft
arrived in Rome from all parts of the known world. I see no difficulty
in recognising the antiquity of this alb. That the great Pope Boniface
VIII. wore it is only a tradition, and no evidence is afforded or
vouched for by the authorities at the Vatican. One evidence of its
origin should not be overlooked which is the material, which I believe
to be the real Byssus, or fine handspun linen from the plant <i>Linum
usitatissimum</i> not at that time available in Europe. Dr. Bock remarks
that this Byssus was much sought for in early Christian times under the
name of Byssus of Alexandria.<a name="FNanchor_K_11" id="FNanchor_K_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_K_11" class="fnanchor">[K]</a> The linen of the Assisi alb is of the
same texture, which I can only describe as crisp and wiry,
notwithstanding that in many parts it is much worn; on handling the
linen it reminded one at once of the linen of Egyptian mummy cloths, and
the Italian curators of both albs, while I must say profoundly
indifferent as to the questions of design and execution, which
interested me most, were all quite certain that they had known no linen
texture resembling it in Italy. It was impossible not to call to mind in
this connection, "Fine linen with broidered work from Egypt was that
which thou spreadest forth to be thy sail."<a name="FNanchor_L_12" id="FNanchor_L_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_L_12" class="fnanchor">[L]</a> The linen of the alb of
Pope Boniface is slightly finer than that of the Assisi alb, and is
heavily worked with lace ornaments of an Eastern character. The repeated
geometrical patterns, or rosettes symmetrically grouped in squares, are
worked by the needle in punto a rammendo (<i>see</i> Plate <a href="#plate_003">3</a>), and the
curious stitch called punto treccia, or tress-work, is introduced, as
well as the punto a stuora, or matting stitch. It may be observed that
in such early lacework the punto a festone, or buttonhole stitch, is
never, or very rarely found, though afterwards it became almost the only
stitch used in all needle-point, until the advent of the réseau.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>In the alb of Pope Boniface there is no buttonhole stitch&mdash;the ornaments
in squares called quadri were inserted in the linen of the alb, and were
surrounded by rows of punto tirato worked in the linen itself. The
flounce and insertions, or "falsature," of pillow-made lace were
evidently added at a later date.</p>

<p>It is interesting to see in the fresco by Giotto (1276-1337), preserved
in St. John Lateran, that Pope Boniface VIII. is supported by two
ecclesiastics, one of whom is wearing an alb with what appears to be
lace on the sleeve.</p>

<p>The tomb of the same pope, and of others of about the same date, afford
still more cogent evidence. In the Crypt of St. Peter's, Rome, Pope
Boniface VIII. is represented in full pontifical vestments lying on a
bier which is draped with a richly ornamental pall; this is raised to
show a linen cloth with a border of reticello work in what is termed by
a learned writer "the well-known geometrical design of the thirteenth
century." The Pope wears an alb with an ornamental border which is
repeated on the sleeves.</p>

<p>The fact is, of course, acknowledged that linen cloth was used for
bed-linen, towels, and other articles. For albs, linen, and linen only,
was ordered by the rubric; therefore, if one sees an alb represented,
whether by painting or sculpture, the intention to represent linen is
implied. And, if ornamented, the intention to represent linen lace is
clear in many instances, although the painter or sculptor cannot, of
course, give us a facsimile as satisfying as the photographs we have
here.</p>

<p>I will here refer to the well-known pictures by Giotto and his school.
One in the Louvre, of the birth of St. John the Baptist, has most
unmistakable lacework on the linen of the bed, and on the long towel
gracefully depicted as hanging from the shoulder of one of the
attendants.</p>

<p>A fresco, also by Giotto, in the Basilica of Assisi, represents the
figure of the Divine Infant in a shirt with reticello ornament.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<p>Duccio di Buoninsegna (1260-1340) and Lorenzetti (1276-1348) may be
mentioned among many others, as in their paintings linen cloths are
rendered with unmistakable needle-point ornament. It is quite clear that
these laces were in general use before the fourteenth century, although
it is not surprising that few specimens remain to us.</p>

<p>The pattern of the lacis, or sfilatura, in Plate No. <a href="#plate_007">7</a>, is geometrical,
with an Eastern tendency, as in Pope Boniface's alb. It is singularly
like the dresses of saints in some of the Ravenna mosaics, and the more
ancient stitches can be seen in the specimen given, but there is no
buttonhole stitch.</p>

<p>In describing the design of this piece of old lacis, I am again tempted
to quote M. Gayet's description of lace found in the Coptic tomb. He
says: "It is lace as it is made to-day. All the threads of the réseau
are drawn together to one point, and the meshes start from the centre
like rays crossing and recrossing and thus forming various patterns."
The pieces of network from these Coptic tombs, preserved in the Victoria
and Albert Museum fully justify this description, and no doubt the
Eastern tradition can be traced in Plate <a href="#plate_007">7</a>.</p>

<p>As we have seen, the ornament of the earliest laces was simple, or
quasi-simple, in design; but even then the craving to represent life
often appears. The band down the front of the Assisi alb, for example,
has a row of stags thoroughly subservient to the distinctly polygonal
idea.</p>

<p>In Plate <a href="#plate_011">11</a> a portion of an early lacis or modano border is represented.
Conventional peacocks and numerous smaller birds are added to the
central design of I.H.S. in Gothic letters&mdash;quaint little angels are at
the ends of some of the rays. The inscription has so far found no
interpreter.</p>

<p>The altar-cloth in Plate <a href="#plate_012">12</a> may possibly have been made for Richard II.;
his two wives were both French, and this piece has the stag, which was
the royal device.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>No. 1 of Plate <a href="#plate_013">13</a> is an interesting border of Sicilian lacis, the design
Eastern, introducing the gammadion, the netting is all made obliquely.
Two stitches are used for the pattern, the punto a rammendo and also the
punto scritto. A vandyked border of punto avorio is added.</p>

<p>In Plate <a href="#plate_014">14</a> the squares of lacis or modano are alternated with linen
worked with reticello. The design in each square is different.</p>

<p>The effect of the gold thread added to the pattern worked in punto a
tela, or linen-stitch, in Plate <a href="#plate_015">15</a>, is very good, and there is much
variety in the execution of this piece.</p>

<p>No. 1 of Plate <a href="#plate_016">16</a> is lacis of possibly German work with a design of
vine-leaves and grapes worked in punto a tela. No. 2 is a vandyked
border of English lacis with a pattern of large and small blossoms&mdash;the
larger ones resemble Tudor roses. Both these pieces have the punto
riccio introduced.</p>

<p>Plate <a href="#plate_017">17</a> is a specimen of lacis called buratto in Italy, as the netting
is twisted and not knotted. The pattern is punto a rammendo, worked with
very coarse thread, but the result is satisfactory. This piece must be
early sixteenth-century work.</p>

<p>The two examples of buratto work in the following plate, Plate <a href="#plate_018">18</a>, are
much more finely worked with punto a rammendo. The narrow border is
probably the earliest.</p>

<p>Alençon has certainly more romantic associations than any other
lace-producing town. For the making of lace at Alençon did not begin
only with the establishment of that industry in 1660, of which I shall
speak later. More than a century before that date Marguérite
d'Angoulême, Duchess of Alençon, and afterwards Queen of Navarre, while
living at her castle of Alençon, worked and caused to be worked,
beautiful ornaments for albs and other articles for use at the altar of
St. Leonard's, her parish church. Some of these are preserved in the
Alençon Museum; a specimen of early lacis is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span> especially interesting,
worked in squares with radiating threads, and the centres worked with
punto a stuora as in Plate <a href="#plate_017">17</a>. The specimen of lacis, with gold thread
introduced similar to that in Plate <a href="#plate_015">15</a>, may very likely be the very
piece alluded to by Clément Marot in his odes to Queen Marguérite. She
died in 1549.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Elle adonnait son courage<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A faire maint bel ouvrage<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>Another interesting record of this Queen is to be found in a manuscript
of the expenses of "Madame Marguérite," sister of the King (Francis I.).
"For 60 yards fine Florence lace for her collars."<a name="FNanchor_M_13" id="FNanchor_M_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_M_13" class="fnanchor">[M]</a> This lace was
probably fine punto in aria worked in points, as in Plate <a href="#plate_030">30</a>, but it
may, of course, also have been bobbin-made lace similar to the edging in
Plate <a href="#plate_029">29</a>.</p>

<p>The earliest example of tela tirata here is a piece representing St.
Francis of Assisi and events of his life, Plate <a href="#plate_019">19</a>. Under the saint's
feet is an inscription imperfectly rendered by the pious worker. St.
Michael is above, and still higher is the Madonna and many emblems or
perhaps fancies of the worker. This lace may have been worked in Assisi
itself in the thirteenth or fourteenth century.</p>

<p>Another early specimen has a man in armour with a helmet of
thirteenth-century shape. <i>See</i> Plate <a href="#plate_020">20</a>.</p>

<p>Another piece, Plate <a href="#plate_021">21</a>, which is very fine and was no doubt worked for
a wedding, represents a bride and bridegroom standing dressed in
sixteenth-century costume and surrounded by attendants. Below is a
hawking party with dogs.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p>The infant's swaddling band, Plate <a href="#plate_022">22</a>, is interesting, as these bands
are no longer ornamented.</p>

<p>The specimen of tela tirata No. 1, in Plate <a href="#plate_025">25</a>, is of singular make, the
whole piece to be worked being prepared by drawing threads at regular
intervals. These same threads are then darned in with a needle to form
the pattern. In this specimen a small piece has been unpicked to show
the way the threads were drawn before beginning the work. This method
has, I believe, not hitherto been noticed, as the plan of cutting
threads and leaving the pattern in the linen is more usual; but, of
course, no cut threads at all remaining in the work rendered it more
even and durable, and so justified the extra trouble.</p>

<p>No. 2 of Plate <a href="#plate_025">25</a>, is a piece of tela tirata with punto reale similar,
though coarser in make, to the work on the Assisi alb.</p>

<p>Three specimens of sixteenth-century linen work, Plate <a href="#plate_028">28</a>, are reduced
in size; one is on a huckaback with a fine macramé fringe. The drawn
work of this piece is beautifully done. The cloth in the centre is
worked in punto riccio and has a border of punto avorio and a curious
fringe. The third is cut and worked in punto riccio and reticello, and
has a border of bobbin-made lace.</p>

<p>In Plate <a href="#plate_029">29</a> we have two examples of reticello, the linen almost entirely
cut away and hidden by the different stitches. The punto a stuora is
still used for the centres, as we have seen in the earlier laces, and
the punto a festone appears for the first time. In the second example we
have a curious combination of three laces&mdash;an upper border worked almost
exactly like the very early lace of Plate <a href="#plate_007">7</a>; then comes an insertion of
reticello, and finally a border of Venetian bobbin-lace (merletto a
fuselli). This is early fifteenth-century work.</p>

<p>We now come to the third division made in needle-point lace&mdash;the punto
in aria, which may be said to be the starting-point of all subsequent
needle-point laces. No linen or netting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span> being used the worker had to
construct her lace&mdash;in aria&mdash;out of nothing, and a splendid opening it
gave, as we shall now see, for invention and for execution. This punto
in aria, worked into points, was extensively used for personal
adornment: these points gave the name of pizzi to lace, a name which
still survives in Italy as comprehensive of all lace, as the name
dentelle is in France. The first examples I give here are the two
dentated (or vandyked) borders of Plate <a href="#plate_031">31</a>.</p>

<p>The chalice cover, Plate <a href="#plate_032">32</a>, is a very interesting combination of
reticello and punto in aria; the lines of the cut-linen foundation are
carried across and form a lattice behind the punto in aria devices. The
beautifully worked waved pattern circling round the design may be
intended to represent St. Peter's chains: the Saint stands with the
Scriptures in one hand and the Keys in the other, and has a winged
cherub on each side; the edge is of punto in aria.</p>

<p>The reticello pattern of Plate <a href="#plate_033">33</a> is beautifully rendered in punto
avorio and punto in aria. This piece, unlike the specimens given before,
has no linen foundation, and therefore is classed as punto in aria and
not as reticello or cutwork.</p>

<p>The corporal border of Plate <a href="#plate_034">34</a>, of very conventional floral pattern is,
I think, undoubtedly of German early seventeenth-century work.</p>

<p>The border of the Venetian cloth in Plate <a href="#plate_035">35</a>, is a very fine specimen of
punto in aria. The two insertions, of which one is given, are alike.
They have strange winged and tailed animals alternating with scrolls and
vases. The vandyked border is a wonderful piece of work containing
altogether forty-eight small figures, and, as is often the case in
Venetian work, the figures, birds and animals have tiny black glass
beads for eyes. The animals have loops of fine buttonhole stitch to
denote manes.</p>

<p>A very interesting and beautiful piece of punto in aria is Plate <a href="#plate_036">36</a>. The
design is still reminiscent of the East; the flowing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span> interlaced
flower-stems, with animals introduced, have quite a Persian effect. But
the beautiful rendering of the pendant flowers, and the true love knots,
as well as the heraldic device of the Visconti (the crowned serpent)
mark the elegance and freedom of the Renaissance. It was, no doubt, made
in Venice in the late sixteenth century.</p>

<p>The punto in aria trimming for the neck of an alb, Plate <a href="#plate_037">37</a>, is a very
remarkable piece, and the execution full of interest. The work is
entirely without foundation. The figures are clothed with mantles of
very beautifully worked network, called in Italy mezza mandolina. The
edges of the mantles are worked in punto avorio. Realism is attempted by
representing the features in relief, and little black beads are added to
the eyes.</p>

<p>A curious border of the Venetian rose-point is No. 1, Plate <a href="#plate_038">38</a>, worked
entirely in punto a festone. Birds and serpents occur, and the thick
cordonnet which outlines the pattern is also used to denote the scales
of the serpents and the feathers of the birds, tiny black beads mark the
eyes as in Plate <a href="#plate_037">37</a>. The edging is of very fine punto avorio. A specimen
of the so-called coraline Venice needle-point is also on this Plate.</p>

<p>In Plate <a href="#plate_039">39</a> we have a very interesting specimen of needle-point as
applied to personal use&mdash;a lady's camisia, or shirt, of the sixteenth
century. The linen has a square hole cut for the head, and this opening
is beautifully worked in punto in aria. The sleeves are ornamental with
oblique bands of cut-work, and the seams everywhere worked with drawn
stitches and insertions of punto avorio. The handwoven linen is in good
condition, although the garment must have been much worn, as the cuffs
have been replaced by bobbin-made frills, trine a fuselli. It is
doubtful whether three hundred years hence any linen garment worn at the
present time will survive.</p>

<p>From the beginning of the sixteenth century the fashion began<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span> of
working portions of the lace separately, and joining them together by
brides, and modes or fillings were also introduced, into the pattern.
Later, from about 1630, the réseau ground was introduced, covering the
whole space between the patterns; the patterns themselves also changed,
and from being geometric and conventional became more and more
realistic. The stately lace of Venice, however, may be said to have
always preserved its conventional tradition, whether in the heavy rose
or raised point or the delicate point à réseau.</p>

<p>Venice obtained her pre-eminence of lace-making in the sixteenth
century. The flat point is probably the earliest distinctive lace; but
this was soon enriched by work upon work, stitch upon stitch, which gave
the name of rose-point or punto in rilievo. The characteristic ornament
in the heavy so-called gros point de Venise consists of conventional
blossoms like leaves and scrolls treated as though carved in ivory or
bone, and to it applies the title of punto tagliato a fogliami. The
brides are sometimes quite plain, but later are adorned with picots.</p>

<p>We now come to the period when lace, so long only made for church
purposes, was very extensively made and used by lay persons for their
personal adornment, and for furnishing purposes. The bed cover Plate <a href="#plate_040">40</a>
was, no doubt, one of many made for a household of simple tastes; the
coarse linen is cut into a fine flowing pattern edged with buttonhole
stitch, and ornamented with various fillings. But in houses of greater
pretension the use of the richest rose-point became lavish, not only on
the dress of the mistress, the collar of the master, but on table covers
and hangings of every kind. Examples of this splendid lace are given in
No. <a href="#plate_042">42</a> and following plates. No. <a href="#plate_044">44</a> has, perhaps, the finest toilé; but
the design of No. <a href="#plate_045">45</a> is very beautiful. No. <a href="#plate_046">46</a> is a flounce for an alb
of very fine scroll design with brides picotées and occasional raised
work; the beauty of the pattern is better seen in the enlargement, Plate
<a href="#plate_047">47</a>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span> The paten cover, No. <a href="#plate_048">48</a>, and the enlargement of it, No. <a href="#plate_049">49</a>, give a
complete idea of the style and execution of this lace.</p>

<p>The design of the flounce, No. <a href="#plate_051">51</a>, is of the style usually associated
with point de France, the stitches and brides picotées are identical in
workmanship with the Venetian point. It was probably made at Alençon,
Sedan, or one of the other lace-making centres which were started upon
the importation of Venetian laceworkers into France after the middle of
the seventeenth century.</p>

<p>The specimens of Spanish rose-point, Nos. <a href="#plate_053">53</a> and <a href="#plate_054">54</a>, show the stately
and elaborate design, rather overloaded with ornament, which is
characteristic of this lace.</p>

<p>The Venetian point à réseau was made from about 1650 in Venice and
Burano. The cap shown in No. <a href="#plate_056">56</a> has a beautiful flowing design of a
scroll with flowers and leaves, and brides connecting some portions of
the design. The main ground is of small mesh réseau worked the length of
the lace, which is often the case in Venetian work, though I have never
seen it in Alençon lace, the réseau being, as far as I know, usually
worked across the lace by the early French workers. (Later, the réseau
of the Alençon lace was worked obliquely, as can be seen by examining
Plate <a href="#plate_067">67</a>, and the specimens I have seen of modern Alençon are also
worked in this way.)</p>

<p>Plates <a href="#plate_059">59</a> and <a href="#plate_060">60</a> show interesting specimens of this very rare Venetian
lace. No. 2, in the latter plate, is probably a specimen worked in
France.</p>

<p>The ground of No. <a href="#plate_059">59</a> is of brides picotées arranged into hexagonal
meshes, a ground which is chiefly associated with the point de France,
and this specimen was no doubt from Alençon.</p>

<p>About 1660 important centres of lace-making were developed and
subsidised in France by the Government at Alençon, Paris, Sedan, and
other places, and the French needle-point then made was scarcely to be
distinguished from the Venetian. This was to be expected, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span> the first
workers of lace of this kind in France were imported from Venice. In a
letter to Colbert, the minister of Louis XIV., dated 1665, Catherine de
Marcq writes, "I am starting for Alençon with four Venetian lace
workers."<a name="FNanchor_N_14" id="FNanchor_N_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_N_14" class="fnanchor">[N]</a></p>

<p>As our King Charles II. revived his father's edict against foreign lace
at about the same time (1662), it would almost seem a concerted action
to check the Italian and Flemish superiority in the fabrication of the
finest lace, whether needle- or bobbin-made. But although the French
were successful in part in rivalling the Venetian needle-point, the
finest bobbin-lace of Flanders was never approached by the English
workers, and now, of course, can never be equalled, as the secret of the
thread used in the finest laces, such as Angleterre, Binche, etc., is
lost.</p>

<p>Nothing was too ambitious for the Venetian or French designers of the
seventeenth century. Coats of arms under canopies, scriptural or
classical figures, wreaths and vases of flowers, were frequently worked
into the same design for a piece of lace. The subsequent changes of
design which took place in the Alençon lace are most interesting to
note, the patterns gradually losing their Venetian character. In No. <a href="#plate_061">61</a>
vases and pots of flowers are introduced, and the floral patterns of the
specimens which follow become more and more realistic in drawing.</p>

<p>Towards the end of the reign of Louis XVI. enormous quantities of lace
were required for the new fashion of frills and flounces, and the change
in design is much marked by the adoption of borders of very light
effect, the réseau ground being spotted with little sprigs, slender
riband devices, and dots or pois, whence the term semé de larmes. (<i>See</i>
Plate <a href="#plate_066">66</a>.) In the numerous specimens shown, the changing fashion can be
marked, until in Plates <a href="#plate_064">64</a> to <a href="#plate_067">67</a> the Venetian character of the designs
of Alençon needle-point has quite disappeared. The patterns are
practically designed for borders <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>only; and the réseau is, as I have
said, spotted with tiny sprigs, or dots. The expression semé de larmes
is said to have arisen in allusion to the misfortunes of Queen Marie
Antoinette, by whom much lace of this style was worn.</p>

<p>In needle-point made at Argentan we find a style and design such as we
should expect from its close neighbourhood to Alençon. The sole
peculiarity of the Argentan workers was that, not content with the
almost incredible toil involved in the lace of Alençon, they actually
worked the whole réseau of their lace over in buttonhole stitch, thus
making those compactly stitched hexagonal meshes which are distinctive
of this wonderful fabric. The Argentan réseau was sometimes introduced
into lace made at Alençon and elsewhere. The specimens, Nos. <a href="#plate_068">68</a> and <a href="#plate_069">69</a>,
are representative of this rare lace.</p>

<p>The two specimens&mdash;one of silk and one of linen thread, Nos. 1 to 2,
Plate <a href="#plate_070">70</a>&mdash;I consider to be Portuguese, from the curious though rather
handsome and effective jumble of design which is often found in Spanish
and Portuguese work.</p>

<p>The Brussels needle-point of No. 3, Plate <a href="#plate_070">70</a>, and Plate <a href="#plate_071">71</a> and Plate <a href="#plate_072">72</a>,
must seem poor and thin when compared to the preceding laces. But it is
very beautiful in its own delicate style, and has been called the
laciest of laces. The réseau is very fragile, hence the name sometimes
given of point de gaze. The designs shown have not the complete realism
aimed at in the Brussels lace of the present day, but have a charm of
their own which I confess attracts me more than all the brilliant
improvements of the last sixty years.</p>

<p>The two specimens of darned work on bobbin net, Plates <a href="#plate_073">73</a> and <a href="#plate_074">74</a>,
especially the latter, are remarkable for the beauty and variety of the
work.</p>

<p>Plate <a href="#plate_075">75</a> and Plate <a href="#plate_076">76</a> have specimens of the beautiful and intricate work
called Tönder muslin lace made in Denmark in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span> the eighteenth
century. The following, Plate <a href="#plate_077">77</a>, is lace of the same kind but made in
South Germany. I obtained these pieces in Leipzig forty years ago.</p>

<p>Number 2, in Plate <a href="#plate_076">76</a>, has a design and fillings which almost recall
those in the finest Alençon laces of the late seventeenth century.</p>

<p>Plate <a href="#plate_078">78</a> has four specimens of eighteenth-century Dutch linen lace made
for caps; it is called Gouda lace; the fillings are very well
done.</p>

<p>In the Manila fibre lace, Plate <a href="#plate_079">79</a>, No. 1, the ground is entirely worked
over by the needle into small squares, giving the appearance of network.
This is done in the same way as the earlier tela tirata, the threads
drawn together and sewn with wonderful regularity, without any thread
being cut.</p>

<p>The two specimens of needle-point, Plate <a href="#plate_079">79</a>, Nos. 2 and 3, made entirely
of human hair, are rather difficult to render in a photograph. They are
evidently copied from Venetian patterns, and the various shades of hair
used have a very pretty effect, while the execution of such fine work in
so fragile a material must have demanded extreme skill and deftness of
hand. They were made about 1800, at the Bar Convent, York.</p>

<p>A very interesting piece of old English needle-point work is No. <a href="#plate_080">80</a>, a
cap of Holy, or Hollie, work. A close réseau is worked by using a stitch
very similar to buttonhole stitch, and the effect is of a texture very
like the cambric it adorns. The pattern is made by missing stitches,
forming small holes.</p>

<p>Hollie lace was chiefly used to decorate infants' caps, etc., for
baptism, and the pot with flower, reminiscent of the Annunciation, the
Holy Dove, etc., were devices frequently introduced into the patterns.
Collars of this work are mentioned in Queen Mary Stuart's inventories.</p>

<p>Number 2, Plate <a href="#plate_080">80</a>, is a specimen of Limerick run lace.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>Three pieces of Irish needle-lace, Nos. 1 and 2 of Plate <a href="#plate_081">81</a>, are
praiseworthy as very early specimens of this industry. The designs are
nondescript, but many of the stitches are well executed. A bobbin-made
tape is introduced in No. 1. No. 3 is the so-called Carrickmacross lace;
a muslin and machine net foundation is neatly outlined by fine whipped
stitches; and buttonhole-stitch brides picotées are used to join the
patterns after the background is cut away. This lace was first made
after the famine of 1846.</p>




<h2><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span><a name="BOBBIN-MADE_LACE" id="BOBBIN-MADE_LACE">BOBBIN-MADE LACE</a></h2>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>The earliest bobbin lace was made by using the same threads for the
whole of the lace, thus, when the pattern had been pricked out and the
requisite number of bobbins charged with thread, the plaiting and
twisting the threads into lace was begun.</p>

<p>The starlike effect in the old Malta laces was very simply made by
taking fourteen bobbins to work a strip of the required length; this was
then joined up as required into a pattern of more or less regular and
starlike form, partly, no doubt, to imitate the older geometric designs.
The same bobbins were used throughout. <i>See</i> Plate <a href="#plate_083">83</a>.</p>

<p>The same style of making is more beautifully carried out in the two
patterns of Plate <a href="#plate_084">84</a>. The lace in No. 1 is unfortunately very much worn,
but the way the bobbin-made strip is arranged to make flowerlike forms
is very ingenious; the ground is completely covered and yet nothing is
awkward or crowded. No. 2 is also a very fine example of this simple
bobbin work. I consider both to be early Venetian.</p>

<p>Number 1 of Plate <a href="#plate_085">85</a> is a typical pattern of the lace which, originally
no doubt inspired by the East has become universal under the name of
"peasant" lace. We find it in Russia, Hungary, Dalmatia, Spain, Sicily,
Sardinia, in fact wherever lace was made at all, this pattern with
slight variations is supreme. Ceylon and India produce very similar
lace, as also does South America. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span> have therefore made no special
reference to these peasant laces, as although quite satisfactory from
the point of view of utility, they are only otherwise interesting as the
product of an industry much to be encouraged.</p>

<p>Numbers 2, 3 and 4, on Plate <a href="#plate_085">85</a>, may be considered as showing a
transition state, as in all three there is an attempt to add a
background to the toile or tapelike pattern.</p>

<p>Number 4 is a specimen of old Maltese lace now no longer made.</p>

<p>Number 1 in Plate <a href="#plate_086">86</a> is of reticello pattern and a very successful
imitation of the needle-point linen lace.</p>

<p>Number 2 is a fine example of the same style worked into points or
pizzi, and is probably Venetian.</p>

<p>Numbers 3, 4 and 5, are examples of Genoese plaited lace.</p>

<p>Number 5 is especially notable as recalling the Eastern tradition.</p>

<p>Plate <a href="#plate_087">87</a> shows two specimens of Genoese lace. No. 2 is what is sometimes
called collar lace, and sometimes Vandyke lace, from the very general
use of it in portraits by that great painter. No. 1 is Genoese fringed
lace. In both the starlike groups of little "grains of corn," as they
are called, are characteristic of Genoese lace, as they are now
considered to be of Maltese. But the Genoese patterns were only
introduced into Malta and Gozo about sixty or seventy years ago. One can
but be glad of the success of an industry so profitable to the
industrious peasantry of those islands, but it is impossible not to
regret the total disappearance of the old style of lace-making. The old
patterns are not in demand for the modern market, which is chiefly
French, and the lace is principally made with silk imported from France.</p>

<p>I find that it is often supposed that no specimens exist of ancient
Maltese lace. It is, however, well known there that lace was made in
Malta and Gozo at all events as early as about 1640. The early flounce
(Plate <a href="#plate_080">80</a>) was bought in Valetta more than fifty years ago, and
inquiries made convince me that it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span> made, as my Maltese informant
expressed it, "before the time of Lascaris." The Maltese often use the
expression "time of Lascaris" or of "Carafa," "Manoel," etc., to date
anything. These were the names of different Grand Masters before the
islanders invited English occupation in 1800. There is no doubt that the
disturbance caused by the French occupation affected lace-making so that
it fell into abeyance, but before that time great quantities of these
simple, strong and useful laces were made, principally, of course for
church use. The narrower edgings (Plate <a href="#plate_098">98</a>) were used for the fine white
lawn head-dresses worn with the beautiful national gala dresses, now
only preserved by the great Maltese families as relics of the past.</p>

<p>Number 1, Plate <a href="#plate_088">88</a>, is a very curious early pattern called gotico in
Italy.</p>

<p>Numbers 2 and 3 are Sicilian peasant laces.</p>

<p>Number 4, Tuscan peasant lace called piedi di gallini (fowls' feet).</p>

<p>Number 5 is a Tuscan peasant lace called zeccatello.</p>

<p>Plate <a href="#plate_089">89</a> illustrates six peasant laces from Russia, Madeira, Portugal,
Ceylon, and Le Puy, made before 1850.</p>

<p>In the Genoese laces in Plates <a href="#plate_090">90</a> and <a href="#plate_091">91</a> we have examples of what may be
called the second manner of bobbin lace. The patterns of conventional
sprays and flowers are made on the pillow separately, and afterwards
joined by brides picotées, also bobbin-made. In the lace made in this
second manner, in which many laces were made at successive periods in
Milan, Genoa, Brussels and Honiton, the threads forming the connecting
brides, and later the réseau, can be detected by looking on the reverse
of the lace, as they are seen passing behind the patterns. An example of
this carrying threads across is shown in the Honiton lace, Plate <a href="#plate_118">118</a>.</p>

<p>Plate <a href="#plate_092">92</a> represents one of the finest examples I have seen of Genoese
bobbin lace, trine a fuselli. The design is of gracefully<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span> arranged
scrolls and flowers, and includes five birds which are introduced in the
most spirited manner. The several tapey shapes, made separately and
joined by brides, form the complete design or pattern, the fillings
between them are very good, and include the starlike work characteristic
of Genoa. This illustration is on a reduced scale in order to show the
pattern of the lace. Plate <a href="#plate_093">93</a> represents the exact size of the same
lace.</p>

<p>Plate <a href="#plate_094">94</a> is a flounce of Milanese bobbin lace, trine a fuselli. The
pattern is of scrolls and flowers, a heraldic crowned eagle and small
birds, with various fillings in the spaces enclosed. A very strong
réseau connects the whole.</p>

<p>Plate <a href="#plate_095">95</a>, a flounce of the same lace, has a very beautiful flowing
design of scrolls, with a background of the characteristic réseau of
Milanese work.</p>

<p>The Milanese alb flounce (Plate <a href="#plate_096">96</a>) is a very fine piece of much later
date. The spaces enclosed by the toilé or tapey parts are filled by
bobbin-made fillings or à jours, of various designs, a very strong and
evenly made réseau connects the whole.</p>

<p>The two specimens of Italian lace, Plate <a href="#plate_097">97</a>, are of very elegant design;
they also have the fond chant pattern of réseau. This style of lace was
made both in North and South Italy up to sixty or seventy years ago, but
coarser thread was then introduced with disastrous effect.</p>

<p>In the narrow Maltese lace of Plate <a href="#plate_098">98</a> we have in No. 1 the réseau
called mariage; this lace, and Nos. 2 and 3, were made in Malta about
1780.</p>

<p>Turning now to the bobbin-made lace of Flanders, I begin with No. 1 on
Plate <a href="#plate_099">99</a>, which has no less than three characteristic lengths joined to
form one border. The straight edge, the rather abrupt design, and the
réseau cinq trous, indicate a Flemish make of lace. The pattern No. 2
has the clear whiter thread outline. This lace is sometimes called
Trolle Kant.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>The cap, Plate <a href="#plate_100">100</a>, is of later date; the réseau cinq trous, worked with
a very opened out effect, can be observed in the fillings.</p>

<p>The early Mechlin lace resembles in design the point d'Angleterre, and,
indeed, also the Alençon lace of the same date. It is most interesting
to compare, say, the Mechlin, Plate <a href="#plate_101">101</a>, with the d'Angleterre, Plate
<a href="#plate_104">104</a>, and the Venise à réseau of Plate <a href="#plate_057">57</a>. Yet the makings of the three
laces are absolutely different&mdash;the Venice entirely by needle; the
Angleterre is made in two different stages of bobbin work; the Mechlin,
as is always the case, was made in the third manner, the threads
originally started on the bobbins carrying the work to a finish, and
ingeniously sufficing for toilé, réseau, and fillings. Later, Mechlin,
for reasons already stated, became a mere border, as shown in Plate <a href="#plate_102">102</a>.
It is no longer made. This is also the case with Binche lace (Plate
<a href="#plate_103">103</a>). A very beautiful fond de neige, used sometimes as a ground and
sometimes as a filling or à jours, distinguishes this lace. The work is
very fine and close, the edge is usually straight. It is sometimes
called fausses Valenciennes.</p>

<p>Brussels gives its name to a variety of beautiful laces. The most
renowned is the point d'Angleterre, made in great quantities during the
later part of the seventeenth century for the English market. The
designs, as on Plate <a href="#plate_104">104</a>, recall those of the Venise à réseau and of
Alençon of the same period; the beautiful flowing garlands, the waved
edge with varied fillings, the brides picotées forming the hexagonal
réseau, will bear comparison with the Venice lace of Plate <a href="#plate_057">57</a>, and the
Alençon of Plate <a href="#plate_063">63</a>. This truly wonderful point d'Angleterre has a very
fine toilé; the flowers and scrolls were first made on the pillow and
then joined by the réseau (vrai Bruxelles), long used for the highest
class of all Brussels bobbin-made laces. Lace of this fineness is no
longer made since the fine handspun thread cannot be obtained.</p>

<p>Brussels lace followed the fashion which, as we have seen, obtained in
France. In the late eighteenth century only a border<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span> was necessary, as
lace was worn in a profusion of flounces and frills; and Plate <a href="#plate_106">106</a> shows
a border very similar in design to the Alençon of the same date. The
delicate flowers and leaves are joined by the fine réseau mentioned
above&mdash;namely Brussels vrai réseau, a title employed to distinguish it
from machine-made net. This last was introduced during the first quarter
of the nineteenth century, and soon gave a different character to
Brussels lace, when the flowers made on the pillow were sewn (appliqué)
to a simple net made sometimes by hand, but more often by machine.</p>

<p>In the Antwerp lace scarf, No. 1, Plate <a href="#plate_107">107</a>, the fond chant or point de
Paris réseau is used, and here we have an example of Potten Kant, or pot
lace, so-called because in early times the subject of the Annunciation,
with the pots of lilies usually added, was introduced into the designs
for it. The indication of flower-pots certainly occurs in many pieces,
though not in mine, and no piece exists, as far as I know, with figures.</p>

<p>The cap of Lille lace, No. 2, Plate <a href="#plate_107">107</a>, has the simple twisted thread
réseau characteristic of this and of Arras lace. It is not to be
distinguished from the réseau often used in Buckingham lace.</p>

<p>We must again notice how similar the design in the fine old Valenciennes
of Plate <a href="#plate_108">108</a> is to that of Alençon needle-point of the same date. The
réseau is closely plaited, and the toilé of the beautiful patterns
compact and clear in definition. No outline or cordonnet is used in
Valenciennes lace. The early lace has what is called the round réseau,
the later Valenciennes made at Yprès has a square réseau (Plate <a href="#plate_109">109</a>).
This latter lace is still made, but has not the charm of the
eighteenth-century lace.</p>

<p>The lace (Plate <a href="#plate_110">110</a>) was probably made in Paris. It is very curious,
with heraldic device of an eagle with a shield; dogs also, and stags,
are introduced. It may have been made <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>for a wedding about 1690. This
lace is often described in the inventories of old families in France as
dentelle de chasse.</p>

<p>The Blonde lace (Plate <a href="#plate_111">111</a>) was made in Chantilly for a wedding in 1820.</p>

<p>Plate <a href="#plate_112">112</a> gives three specimens of bobbin-made lace, with the so-called
maglia di Spagna, or Spanish mesh. No. 1 is of linen thread, with a
coarser thread introduced; but one should remark that this thread is not
used to outline the pattern as in Flemish lace. I have not met this
réseau in any Flemish lace. Nos. 2 and 3 are bobbin-made silk lace, and
were ruffles for a Court dress-coat.</p>

<p>The black mantilla, Plate <a href="#plate_113">113</a>, has the fond chant réseau used as a
filling, and, although bought in Madrid in 1840, it may have been made
in France.</p>

<p>The difficulty of working the materials of gold and silver lace is so
great that absolute regularity of either pattern or réseau is
impossible. This, however, in my opinion, only renders these rare laces
more interesting. Both metals are used in the characteristic specimen of
sixteenth-century Spanish lace, No. 1 in Plate <a href="#plate_114">114</a>.</p>

<p>Number 2 is a silver seventeenth-century lace from Genoa, the edge is a
shell pattern, and several thicknesses of the metal-covered silk thread
are used. Plate <a href="#plate_115">115</a> has four patterns of seventeenth-century gold and
silver lace made in Italy, probably at Lucca.</p>

<p>The Brussels lappet, made in 1849, Plate <a href="#plate_116">116</a>, was then considered one of
the finest ever made, the pattern is pretty and realistic, and
foreshadows the style since prevalent.</p>

<p>The Bedfordshire lappet, on the same plate, is far inferior in
execution, but was made by a cottager at about the same time and has
done good service.</p>

<p>Two patterns of Buckinghamshire lace, Plate <a href="#plate_117">117</a>, made about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span> 1790, show
more even workmanship than is generally seen in this lace. No. 2 has a
likeness to the Mechlin and Lille lace of the same date; No. 1 is more
like the Flemish Trolle Kant, and was, in fact, called Trolly lace. It
will be observed that the fillings have the six-pointed star, or fond
chant réseau, so prevalent in pillow lace.</p>

<p>There is a tradition that the art of bobbin-made lace was imported into
Devonshire by emigrants from the Netherlands, flying from the tyranny of
the Duke of Alva. Mr. Seguin, in his learned book, contends that the
troubles in Flanders had completely destroyed the lace industry before
Philip II. of Spain sent the notorious Duke of Alva there. I believe,
however, both that lace-making existed before that time in England, and
that the emigration had a beneficial effect on all English industry,
although not an initial one.</p>

<p>I have given both the right and wrong side of the Honiton lace
cap-border in Plate <a href="#plate_118">118</a>, to show the threads of the connecting réseau,
passing behind the patterns, the thread making the brides picotées also
passes in the same manner.</p>

<p>Plate <a href="#plate_119">119</a> shows a remarkably fine specimen of Honiton bobbin lace. The
flowers are made separately in this specimen, and are afterwards joined
by twisted brides claires made with a needle. The design is of birds,
butterflies, and the rose, shamrock, and thistle. It was, perhaps, made
to commemorate the Union.</p>

<p>Plate <a href="#plate_120">120</a> is of Honiton sprays applied to machine-made net.</p>

<p>Space does not admit of any attempt to give a complete Bibliography. I
find that a mere list of books that I have consulted at different times
would be too long. I will therefore only mention that the works of the
following authors would be very valuable to those intending to pursue
this subject.</p>

<p>A fairly complete list of Italian and German pattern-books will be found
in Mrs. Bury Palliser's "History of Lace." And the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span> works of Mr. Alan
Cole, Dr. Franz Bock, Father Braun, S.J., Dr. Moritz Dreger and Dr. Ilg
of Vienna, Dr. Daniel Rock, Mons. Seguin, and Mr. Verhaagen have all
been especially useful; and while preparing this for the press I have
seen with great delight the splendid book of illustrations of Italian
needle lace compiled by Signora Elisa Ricci.</p>

<p>In concluding these remarks, I must say that I owe the first idea of
writing on this subject to my learned and accomplished husband, Mr. John
Hungerford Pollen. Much information was given me in long bygone days by
Dr. Daniel Rock, and by another old friend, Mrs. Bury Palliser, who gave
me one of my first specimens in 1862.</p>

<p>At the present time I owe many thanks for advice and supervision to Mr.
Alan Cole, whose knowledge of lace is unsurpassed.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
